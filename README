This library implements zero-knowledge on SNARKs.

The noisy nature of LWE encryptions makes their employment on SNARKs not as
elegant as previous implementations (so is Mangiafuoco in «Le avventure di
Pinocchio»).
Yet, this project was moved by compassion for zero-knowledge proofs, and their
survival after the advent of quantum computers.


This library does not give any guarantees about constant-time operations, memory
access patterns, or resistance to side-channel attacks.
